  <p>Toppers from all exams say “Solving more number of the practice tests helps to achieve a higher score and crack any exam”
   Following this, Institutes/Teachers are expected to conduct more number of practice tests from question banks for  o their students to achieve a higher score in exams
   , for which Institute/Teachers need to prepare more and more Question Papers. 
   This is very difficult to do with the conventional way of preparing Question papers.
   question papre framers to break all barriers and prepare Question Paper whether it is IN-SEM or FINAL or any other practice tests with less time.
     This will definitely help institutes to improve on student's results.</p>
